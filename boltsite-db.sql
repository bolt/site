This release contains some minor security-related fixes. Even though it has been less than two months since our last feature-release, we''ve made a lot of improvements and enhancements.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Apart from the new features and functional improvements (more on that below), we''ve done a lot of work on <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.bolt.cm\">our documentation<\/a>, and we''ve created a new page listing <strong><a href=\"\/features\">Bolt''s significant features<\/a><\/strong>.&nbsp;\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n  To upgrade an existing install, or to setup a new one, just follow the instructions <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.bolt.cm\/installation\">for installation<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.bolt.cm\/upgrading\">for upgrading<\/a>. When you do an upgrade, you will not overwrite your modified settings with the upgrade. You should still make a backup before doing an upgrade, though.

We''ve found that when you''re working on content, almost all of the time you either need to upload a new file, of you need one that you''ve uploaded very recently. Our Stack functionality keeps track of your latest uploaded files, and allows you to access them as conveniently as possible.\r\n    <br \/><img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 296px; height: 250px;\" src=\"\/files\/2013-11\/stack.png\" \/><\/li>\r\n  <li>Bolt now keeps a <strong>running log of all changes<\/strong> to the content. If you''re working with a team of editors, you''ll be able to see who edited which page on the website. You know, so you can blame whoever introduced a particularly embarrassing typo.<\/li>\r\n  <li>The automatic thumbnails are much more performant now. <strong>Generated thumbnails<\/strong> get saved to the filesystem, so the webserver can access them directly, thereby completely bypassing the entire PHP layer. Before version 1.3, Bolt already cached the resized images, but you still had the overhead of PHP. This change makes image-heavy sites feel a lot more responsive.<\/li>\r\n  <li>We\u2019ve incorporated the acclaimed <strong>Symfony Developer Toolbar<\/strong>, and modified it to Bolt\u2019s specific needs. When developing a website, the toolbar is invaluable to see which templates are used, which routes matched, what the environment variables are, which queries the database did, and how much time and memory it took to render the page.<img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 792px; height: 245px;\" src=\"\/files\/2013-11\/toolbar.png\" \/><\/li>\r\n  <li>We\u2019ve made a bunch of improvements to our built-in <strong>search functionality<\/strong>:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>The search algorithm works much better when having more than one search term. The index-scores of the individual search terms are added to each other, making the best&nbsp;results automatically float to the top.<\/li>\r\n      <li>Taxonomies (tags and categories) are also indexed now.<\/li>\r\n      <li>By default the search engine yields pretty good results, because the algorithm gives higher scores matches in titles than a match somewhere halfway down the content. However, you can manually override the search weights for fields and taxonomies for each individual one. This way, you can influence the scores how you want them.<\/li>\r\n    <\/ul>\r\n  <\/li>\r\n  <li>We added a new <strong>RelatedContentByTags extension<\/strong>. This extension makes it very simple to add \u2018related content\u2019 links to any page. The algorithm calculates the relevance of other content (in the same or in another content type) based on the used tags. If you\u2019re tagging your content consistently, the automatic results are very accurate.<\/li>\r\n  <li>Speaking of which: to aid in using tags consistently, we\u2019ve added a <strong>tag selection cloud<\/strong> to the backend, as well as a autocomplete suggestion.

Get the latest <a href=\"http:\/\/bolt.cm\/distribution\/bolt_latest.tgz\">.tgz<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/bolt.cm\/distribution\/bolt_latest.zip\">.zip<\/a>, or browse the folder with <a href=\"http:\/\/bolt.cm\/distribution\/\">the distributions<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Major improvements and changes in this release, since Bolt 1.2:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>We\u2019ve added a new piece of functionality called \u201c<strong>The Stack<\/strong>\u201d. We''ve found that when you''re working on content, almost all of the time you either need to upload a new file, of you need one that you''ve uploaded very recently. Our Stack functionality keeps track of your latest uploaded files, and allows you to access them as conveniently as possible.<br \/><img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 296px; height: 250px;\" src=\"\/files\/2013-11\/stack.png\" \/><\/li><li>Bolt now keeps a <strong>running log of all changes<\/strong> to the content. If you''re working with a team of editors, you''ll be able to see who edited which page on the website. You know, so you can blame whoever introduced a particularly embarrassing typo.<\/li><li>The automatic thumbnails are much more performant now. <strong>Generated thumbnails<\/strong> get saved to the filesystem, so the webserver can access them directly, thereby completely bypassing the entire PHP layer. Before version 1.3, Bolt already cached the resized images, but you still had the overhead of PHP. This change makes image-heavy sites feel a lot more responsive.<\/li><li>We\u2019ve incorporated the acclaimed <strong>Symfony Developer Toolbar<\/strong>, and modified it to Bolt\u2019s specific needs. When developing a website, the toolbar is invaluable to see which templates are used, which routes matched, what the environment variables are, which queries the database did, and how much time and memory it took to render the page.<img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 735px; height: 244px;\" src=\"\/files\/2013-11\/Screen Shot 2013-11-07 at 16.13.36.png\" \/><\/li><li>We\u2019ve made a bunch of improvements to our built-in <strong>search functionality<\/strong>:<ul><li>The search algorithm works much better when having more than one search term. The index-scores of the individual search terms are added to each other, making the best&nbsp;results automatically float to the top.<\/li><li>Taxonomies (tags and categories) are also indexed now.<\/li><li>By default the search engine yields pretty good results, because the algorithm gives higher scores matches in titles than a match somewhere halfway down the content. However, you can manually override the search weights for fields and taxonomies for each individual one. This way, you can influence the scores how you want them.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>We added a new <strong>RelatedContentByTags extension<\/strong>. This extension makes it very simple to add \u2018related content\u2019 links to any page. The algorithm calculates the relevance of other content (in the same or in another content type) based on the used tags. If you\u2019re tagging your content consistently, the automatic results are very accurate.<\/li><li>Speaking of which: to aid in using tags consistently, we\u2019ve added a <strong>tag selection cloud<\/strong> to the backend, as well as a autocomplete suggestion. This greatly reduces misspellings or variants of the same tag. No more \u201cstarwars\u201d, \u201cstar wars\u201d and \u201cstar-wars\u201d!&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 772px; height: 328px;\" src=\"\/files\/2013-11\/tags.png\" \/><\/li><li>You can now set global <strong>Swiftmailer settings<\/strong> in <code> config.yml <\/code> , for example to make Switmailer use STMP or a specific server.<\/li><\/ul><p>All in all, there have been about 350 commits to our Github repository. Too much to list them all, but some of the other fixes and additions are:<\/p><ul><li>Some <strong>security-related issues<\/strong> have been fixed:<ul><li>Fixed a few (theoretical) XSS problems in both the frontend and backend of the site.<\/li><li>Better cleanup of user-submitted queries to prevent XSS and passing through of control-characters<\/li><li>Require <code> POST <\/code> instead of allowing <code> GET <\/code> for several functions in the backend<\/li><li>Added the option to use other (better) random number generators, for more randomness in generated keys, passwords and hashes.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Added more locations where you can upload files (in the WYSIWYG editors, in the file management screen, in the sidebar). Same goes for uploading and inserting documents in the editor.<\/li><li>Updated Symfony components to 2.3.6<\/li><li>Updated Silex to 1.1.1<\/li><li>Added Codeception testing framework, and added a bunch of functional tests that are run continously by Travis. This is still a work in progress: More tests are added over time.<\/li><li>Added Krumo, for easier dumping and debugging of variables.<br \/><img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 389px; height: 256px;\" src=\"\/files\/2013-11\/krumo.png\" \/><\/li><li>Added new RSSAggregator extension. Thanks, @sekl<\/li><li>Sitemap extension automatically adds a header to the HTML<\/li><li>You can now use relative dates in the where-parts of <code> {<span>% setcontent %<\/span>} <\/code> , like \u201clast monday\u201d and \u201cnext year\u201d<\/li><li>Added a <code> ||| <\/code> -parameter to the query part of set content, so we can use multiple columns as OR clauses<\/li><li>Fix for <code> || <\/code> and <code> &amp;&amp; <\/code> in queries, when having more than two values.<\/li><li>Added <code> ceil <\/code> and <code> floor <\/code> filters, to round numerical values up or down to the nearest integer value.<\/li><li>Added <code> slug <\/code> filter, to dynamically create a \u201csluggified\u201d version of any string.<\/li><li>Added Hungarian translations<\/li><li>Updated Finnish translations<\/li><li>Added Brazilian Portugese translation<\/li><li>Updated Spanish translation<\/li><li>Updated Italian translations<\/li><\/ul>"]}',	NULL);

This release contains a bunch of new features, and no security-fixes. It has been only six weeks since the release of Bolt 1.4, but we still managed to get quite a few nice improvements done in the last month-and-a-half. See below for the details.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>As you might\u2019ve heard: This will be the last feature-release of Bolt 1.x, as we\u2019re now shifting our attention towards Bolt 2.0. At the end of march 2014 we\u2019ll release Bolt 2.0. The most signifcant features of that release will be a redesign of the Backend (both in visuals as well as in functionality) and the marketplace to share your Themes and Extensions. Want to help? You can! More on this can be found here. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/>Highlights of this release:<\/p><ul><li>Caching: Bolt now has Built-in support for full-page and request caching. Using this allows you to significantly speed up the frontend of your websites. If enabled, cached pages can be shown without the need to gather data from the Databases and rendering the pages. For example, see this screenshot of the profiler for a cached page. You\u2019ll see the entire \u2018controller\u2019 part is skipped, ad soon as Bolt determined the visitor can be served a page that has been cached.&nbsp;<br \/>Note: When logged in, you will not see this behaviour by default. Logged-in users will always get a \u2018fresh\u2019 page, to make sure they will see all latest changes.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Roles and Permissions. We now have support for a more extensive Roles and Permissions structure in Bolt. It is designed in such a way that it\u2019s very non-obtrusive when working with a small team, but it allows for very fine-grained control over who\u2019s allowed to do what, if that\u2019s what you need. Every aspect of this is controlled by the new `permissions.yml file: You can define roles, and set up permissions that are global or specific to one or more contenttypes. The default file will suffice for the vast majority of websites, but you can add as many roles\/permissions as you like.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We have a brand-new MenuEditor extension, contributed by @bacbos. This extension will allow you (or your editors) to manage the menus in menu.yml in a visual way. Of course this extension works with our new Roles and Permissions, so you can determine who should have access to it, and who shouldn\u2019t.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Added a new MetaTags extension, for easier insertion of meta tags into the HTML source of your pages, and \u201cSEO\u201d-ing your titles.<\/li><li>Bolt can be configured to use SSL-only (\u2018https\u2019), for all access to the backend.&nbsp;<\/li><li>You can now add custom views for contenttype listings in the overview and the dashboard<\/li><li>Menus in `meny.yml` can now be nested deeper than two levels.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Simpleforms: Option to log user\u2019s IP-address and timestamp of when the form was posted<\/li><li>Simpleforms: Option to disable the built-in CSRF protection<\/li><li>Simpleforms: Added option to use ReCapthca in your forms. Thanks, @julianxhokaxhiu<\/li><li>Updated Dutch, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and French translations<\/li><li>Added Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l. Thanks, @hansfn<\/li><li>Added new \u201cFilelist\u201d field for Contenttypes. Thanks, @doertedev<\/li><li>Replaced the quirky cleanup of HTML with HTMLmaid component. Thanks, @tdammers<\/li><li>Improved the \u201cImportWXR\u201d extension (for PivotX and Wordpress): It uses way less memory, imports categories, and other tweaks.<\/li><li>Streamlined the \u2018save\u2019 workflow. And prevent closing window\/tab with unsaved changes.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We added a new \u201cPasswordProtect\u201d extension<\/li><li>The record.previous() and record.next() can now use&nbsp;\u2018where\u2019 statements for mor control over what constitutes of the&nbsp;\u2018previous\u2019 or&nbsp;\u2018next'' item.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Images can now be deleted in the File browser.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Updated Symfony to 2.4.0. The most notable aspect of this for Bolt users are the improvements to the developer toolbar.<\/li><li>Tweaked timthumb.php. It should now work properly on all kinds of odd servers, proxy-settings and old browsers alike.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Major refactoring on&nbsp;\u2018bootstrap.php\u2019 and&nbsp;\u2018app.php\u2019. Moved all relevant code to it\u2019s own class, and streamlined all the providers. Removed and refactored out quite a bit of dead code. Large parts of the codebase have been cleaned up to adhere to the PSR-2 standard.<\/li><li>And, as usual, there\u2019s quite a few bugfixes and smaller improvements in this release.<\/li><\/ul><p>To upgrade an existing install, or to setup a new one, just follow the instructions&nbsp;for installation&nbsp;orfor updating. When you do an upgrade, you will not overwrite your modified settings with the upgrade. You should still make a backup before doing an upgrade, though.

Bolt will generate URLs like \r\n    <code>\/pages\/<\/code>\r\n     and \r\n    <code>\/page\/about<\/code>\r\n    , but it will accept both with or without trailing slash. Thanks<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jcracknell\">@jcracknell<\/a><\/li>\r\n  <li>The plural and singular of a contenttype can now be the same.

You''ll get returned to the dashboard, or the correct overview page, keeping the current position or filtering.<\/li>\r\n  <li>Added the functionality for extensions to dynamically add their own tables to the database, and keep them updated between versions. Just like the tables in Bolt itself.<\/li>\r\n  <li>Added a new WaffleOrders extension. Mainly interesting for those of you who are interested in writing extensions, because it''s a good example of how to create your own tables and database-handling in an extension.<\/li>\r\n  <li>Several minor security-related issues were fixed:\r\n    <ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 30px; margin: 0px;\">\r\n      <li>Implemented CSRF for contentedit<\/li>\r\n      <li>Use POST for user actions, with a CSRF token<\/li>\r\n      <li>Regenerate session ID when logging in \/ out<\/li>\r\n      <li>Some extra sanitising for filenames of uploaded files.

Thanks, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/terwey\">@terwey<\/a>!<\/li>\r\n  <li>Symfony updated to version 2.4.2<\/li>\r\n  <li>Added an extra check for DB-connectivity.

(mostly thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rixbeck\">@rixbeck<\/a>)<\/li>\r\n  <li>Updated several translations, like Dutch and Hungarian<\/li>\r\n  <li>Compatibility fix for Apache 2.4 in .htaccess. Hopefully fixes <a title=\".htaccess FilesMatch section: Order directive deprecated in Apache 2.4\"  href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bolt\/bolt\/issues\/926\">#926<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n  <li>Added option to disable Silex'' built-in native filebased session handler.<\/li>\r\n  <li>Fix for adding \"date\" and \"datetime\" fields in SQLite.

Fixes <a title=\"Date : Cannot add a NOT NULL column with default value NULL\"  href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bolt\/bolt\/issues\/911\">#911<\/a><\/li>\r\n  <li>The \"order()\"-filter now accepts two parameters, for more fine-grained ordering.

Fixes <a title=\"Re-initializing database with existing cookies throws exception\"  href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bolt\/bolt\/issues\/891\">#891<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n  <li>Tweaked the header bar.

We didn''t really plan for this version after the release of 1.5, but we kept on making smaller improvements, and we had a _lot_ of people contribute smaller or bigger fixes, features and other improvements. As such, this release provides a really solid base, going forward.\r\n\r\nAmongst all the other improvements and fixes, we''ve had to introduce two \"breaking changes\", in order to prepare the codebase for the upcoming big 2.0 release. Please read below for instructions on how to make sure the upgrade goes smoothly. Also, if you did the upgrade without preparation, and something is broken now: GO READ BELOW!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, we had to introduce two changes, that might require a bit of preparation when updating. These are edge-cases, so perhaps you might have to take care of them both, or perhaps neither. The changes are:\r\n\r\nChange 1: Twig inside content\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nFor security-reasons, you will not be able to insert {{twig}}-tags into _content_ anymore, unless you''ve explicitly allowed this in your contenttype. Also, the Twig parser in content now uses it''s own environment, so it''s scope is separated from Bolt''s internal scope. The way templates are parsed hasn''t changed at all, only the content.\r\n\r\nFor example: until version 1.6, you could do this in a template: `{{ dump(app.config.get(''general'')) }}` and it would show your entire config in the browser, including the database specifics. True, you''d have to be logged in to do this, but this still isn''t a desirable situation. We''ve taken the following steps to prevent this from accidentally happening: \r\n  - You need to explicitly allow twig in your contenttype. \r\n  - If you''re building an extension, you need to explicitly allow using it inside content fields.\r\n  - Twig in content uses it''s own environment to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.\r\n  - Some functions like `{% include %}`, `{{ dump() }}` and `{{ redirect() }}` are disabled inside content.\r\n\r\nFrom our experience most websites using Bolt, never use twig _inside_ the content, so for these sites no changes are required. If you _do_ use Twig inside your content, you will need to modify the contenttypes to allow this. This is done on a per-field basis, using the `allowtwig: true` setting:  \r\n\r\n```\r\nentries:\r\n    name: Entries\r\n    singular_name: Entry\r\n    fields:\r\n        ...\r\n        body:\r\n            type: html\r\n            height: 300px\r\n            allowtwig: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange 2: Using keys for content-types\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor contenttypes where no slug was explicitly set, Bolt used to determine the slug of that contenttype primarily by the ''title'', and now we use the ''key'' in the YML. If you''re already used to explicitly defining the `slug: ` in your contenttypes, this change will **not** affect you. For example, you''re fine if your contenttypes look like this: \r\n\r\n```yml\r\nentries:\r\n    name: Entries\r\n    singular_name: Entry\r\n    slug: entries\r\n    fields:\r\n        title:\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you did _not_ set the slug explicitly, and the ''key'' is different than a sluggified version of the ''name'', you need to change this. For example, this case is not OK:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ncontenttype1:\r\n    name: Entries\r\n    singular_name: Entry\r\n    fields:\r\n        title:\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, you should set the `slug:` before updating, so that it matches the `name:`. Like this: \r\n\r\n```yml\r\ncontenttype1:\r\n    name: Entries\r\n    singular_name: Entry\r\n    slug: entries\r\n    fields:\r\n        title:\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the update you should check the ''overview'' page in the Bolt backend for\r\nall of your contenttypes. If it shows your content, you''re good! If it shows an\r\nempty screen, you will need to edit `contenttypes.yml` to correct this, as\r\ndescribed above. If you forget this step, Bolt might not recognize the tables as\r\ntheir correct names, requiring you to rename the tables manually to access your\r\ndata. **No data will be lost** in either case, but we still feel the need to\r\npoint out that you should make a backup before updating."],"datecreated":[null,"2014-05-09 12:11:21"],"datepublish":[null,"2014-05-09 12:10:42"],"datedepublish":[null,"1900-01-01 00:00:00"],"status":[null,"published"],"ownerid":[null,"1"]}',	1);

(This has been started already)</li><li>Take three weeks to iron out the kinks, and finish the last parts of functionality, according to our roadmap</li><li>That said: this weekend, we&#39;re going to make a definitive list (on our Github tracker) of the things that need to be done for 1.0, and the things that will be added later.</li><li>At the beginning of february we will release an RC, for final testing.</li><li>About a week later we&#39;ll release Bolt 1.0 final.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>See the <a href="http://docs.bolt.cm/roadmap">updated Roadmap</a> for details.</p><p>In the meantime, please help us test the current release, and report back on issues that you might find. If you&#39;d like to help coding or writing documentation: See <a href="https://github.com/bobdenotter/bolt/issues?state=open">our tracker</a> on what needs to be done, and feel free to get in touch, if you&#39;d like to get help on how to get started!&nbsp;</p>',	'2013-01/engage.jpeg',	'');

  Actually, when you update to the latest version, you''ll notice that this is in fact version 1.1.2. Last weekend we packaged the release and were all ready to release 1.1.0, but we discovered two annoying bugs that we wanted to fix first. But, 1.1.0 was already uploaded to the distribution folder, so we had to bump the version number, to avoid confusion.
</p>
<p>
  Changelog for this release:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We''ve slightly tweaked the user-interface: A bit less rounded corners, a bit more spacing between items, a different font. Nothing drastic or rigorous, just small, subtle changes. Take a look at these two screenshots for a comparison. (you can use the left and right arrow keys to switch between them)

    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Recently, both Silex 1.0.0 stable and Symfony 2.3.0 have been released. As you might know, Bolt uses Symfony components extensively, so we''re happy that we can now use the stable versions of these components. There have been minor or major updates to a lot of the other components and libraries Bolt uses. Including, but not limited to: jQuery and jQueryUI, CKEditor, Codemirror, Backbone.js and Underscore.js
  </li>
  <li>
    We added indices to the database, we''re using 
    <code>Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Comparator</code>
    to compare and alter table definitions. You can define indices for fields in contenttype.yml, to allow for more performant queries.
  </li>
  <li>
    Smoother automatic creation and updating of all database tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    The parameters in 
    <code>{<span>% setcontent %</span>}</code>
    can be used in any order now. Fixes #363.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added the ''printquery'' parameter, to show the SQL query that''s generated behind the screens. We''ve also added some measures to prevent infinite loops.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bolt now allows taxonomies in 
    <code>{<span>% setcontent %</span>}</code>
    like 
    <code>where { tags: ''foo'' }</code>
    and 
    <code>where { categories: ''bar'' }</code>
    . Fixes #206.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a small notice to the Dashboard for when javascript is disabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    We''ve created an ''ImportWXR'' extension, that can be used to import content from Wordpress or PivotX installs.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Bolt backend is now localized. Currently available are English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Finnish, Italian and Russian. Translations are stored in .yml files, and can be edited/improved directly from the Bolt user interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    We''ve added a ''localdate''-filter for displaying localized dates and timestamps in the frontend, using any installed system locale.
  </li>
  <li>
    We''ve made many improvements to Extensions. Adding your own controllers, Twig functions or Filters is much simpler and more consistent. Accessing an extension''s data is much more straightforward, and there''s a 
    <code>$this-&gt;config</code>
    , which contains the extension''s settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>{<span>{ print() }</span>}</code>
    and 
    <code>Util::var_dump</code>
    now displays collapsibles as closed by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    Much improvements have been made to the Wysiwyg component (CKEditor). You can now easily insert Youtube or Vimeo embeds, insert images that can be selected from previously uploaded files and internal links to other Bolt records can be made.
  </li>
  <li>
    The wysiwyg editor itself uses Codemirror to edit the source code, giving a much more readable overview of your content''s HTML.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added "Autogrow" to CKeditor, with some sensible defaults.{{ fancybox("2013-06/codemirror.png", 320, 240) }}
  </li>
  <li>
    New feature: You can now ''brand'' the Bolt backend with a name, contact info, and a custom location to logon to the backend.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added listing_template option to taxonomies for setting a custom listing template for a taxonomy Fixes #331.
  </li>
  <li>
    Taxonomies can now have ''pretty names'', when using a hash instead of a simple array:
  </li>
</ul>
<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">
categories:
name: Categories
singular name: Category
behaves like: categories
options: { kittens: ''cute kittens'', ducklings: ''fluffy ducklings'', molerats: ''Bald molerats'' }
</pre>
<ul>
  <li>
    There''s a better, new login-screen. We''ve also added a ''forgotten password'' feature.
  </li>
  <li>
    We''ve overhauled the way sessions work. We''re keeping our own sessions now, alongside PHP''s default sessions. This means your session will stay active when PHP decides to clean up lingering sessions. As an added benefit, you can now see which users are logged in from which location, and when they were last active. A user now has the ability to manually log off, which will end all sessions for that user.
    <br />
    {{ fancybox("2013-06/sessions.png", 320, 240) }}
  </li>
  <li>
    A lot more settings can be configured in 
    <code>config.yml</code>
    . If you''re upgrading, be sure to check the default 
    <code> config.yml.dist</code>
    for examples. Examples of these are the branding, ckeditor settings, thumbnail settings and the locale.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a lot of default option for incomplete 
    <code>config.yml</code>
    files
  </li>
  <li>
    Don''t check the database for incorrect tables from the dashboard more often than once per hour, per session. Improves performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Long overdue new feature: "Browse on server" option for image fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some minor fixes to 
    <code>{<span>{ menu }</span>}</code>
    tag. Allows passing extra parameters now. We''ve also made the entire 
    <code>{<span>{ record }</span>}</code>
    available in each menu-item.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a ''checkbox'' field for use in contenttypes.
  </li>
  <li>
    We no longer let Silex cache frontend pages, since it would give weird results. You can expect a proper cache in Bolt 1.2.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix for when news.bolt.cm is not reachable or gives invalid JSON: Don''t block the backend UI. Fixes #409
  </li>
  <li>
    We always properly escape ''negated'' fieldnames like "-id" in 
    <code>{<span>% setcontent %</span>}</code>
    and contenttypes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure ''date'' and ''datetime'' fields are initialised properly. Adding defaults to ''date'' and ''datetime'' in 
    <code> contenttype.yml.dis</code>
    t for kitchensink. Fixes #388.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don''t just sort inside of groups, but also sort the groups themselves according to the order in 
    <code>taxonomy.yml</code>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix a minor bug in taxonomies: has_sortorder works again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixing a ''sprintf'', filtering in the sidebar works again.
  </li>
  <li>
    We implemented a bunch of smaller improvements to SimpleForm extension: We added 
    <code>submitter_cc</code>
    to SimpleForms. We also added redirection to Simpleforms, and the option to store results in a database table.
  </li>
  <li>
    Database fix: When an "update" doesn''t work, attempt to "insert" a record, before giving up.
  </li>
  <li>
    Re-add the propertychange and input events, keep change for supporting change in a selectbox. Change them to namespaced events.
  </li>
  <li>
    Display placeholders for thumbnails and videos in backend. Also cleaning up various bits of javascript.
  </li>
  <li>
    Merged 
    <code>searchresults.twig</code>
    into 
    <code>listing.twig</code>
    . Less mandatory templates!
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow some timthumb settings to be set in our 
    <code>config.yml</code>
    . Fixes #350.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added "Whoops" error handler. When working on a site, errors are presented with much more information and a stacktrace, to simplify debugging.
  </li>
  <li>
    Show "showing page x of y" in overview. Fixes #348. Fix retrieving of relations by removing unneeded 
    <code>quote()</code>
    The ''uses'' value for slugs in contenttypes now support multiple fields, so you can create slugs like 
    <code>''123-lorem-ipsum''</code>
    for 
    <code>[id, title]</code>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a bunch of sanity checks for contenttypes. Fixes #285, fixes #286.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix: don''t set the slug for contenttype in 
    <code>getContentType()</code>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Clear cache has it''s own (simple) page now. Fixes #256. Multiple smaller fixes for NiceUrls extension. "Developer" and "Admin" users always have access to all of the contenttypes. Fixes #283.
  </li>
  <li>
    New feature: Allow 
    <code>default_status</code>
    in contenttype. Fixes #284.
  </li>
  <li>
    New feature: Set the canonical in the 
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
    -section of the page, and also fix the link to content pages. Fixes #279.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prevent slugs from starting or ending with a ''-''.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finetuning the new ''add dummy content'' functionality. Closes #241
  </li>
  <li>
    New feature: Config setting for favicon location. Fixes #276.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prevent "Flash of unstyled content" for debug bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extra replacement for windows-servers running fast_cgi: replace drive-letter in paths. Fixes #323.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bolt no longer adds html-snippets ''at random'', but only in actual frontend pages. (not in the backend or asynchronous request) Contenttypes can now be overridden. Before, all records were always 
    <code>\Bolt\Content</code>
    , but now you can define a 
    <code>class:</code>
    in your contentype''s 
    <code>.yml</code>
    , and that class will be used. All you need to do is extend 
    <code>\Bolt\Content</code>
    in your extension, and you''re good to go.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made taxonomies a bit more flexible. Now 
    <code>/category/foo</code>
    works, just like 
    <code>/categories/foo</code>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixing two notices for when a taxonomy is removed from 
    <code>taxonomies.yml</code>
    .

  <li>
    Better support for SQlite and PostgreSQL.

  <li>
    Added Lowlevelcheck for '' 
    <code>magic_quotes</code>
    ''. Don''t just break, but show a proper error page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added an extra check, so people who still have php 5.2 get a sensible error message. Fixes #235.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don''t do half-assed attempt at caching, just return the results. Fixes #251.
  </li>
  <li>
    "sort" in 
    <code>contenttype.yml</code>
    doesn''t understand ''-id'', when used together with Grouping. Fixes #382.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure ''posted'' date and datetime end in "00:00", not ":00". Fixes #243
  </li>
  <li>
    Use prepared statements for all queries, where applicable
  </li>
  <li>
    There''s a ''preview'' button when editing content.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    Added 
    <code>{<span>{ foo|first }</span>}</code>
    and 
    <code>{<span>{ foo|last }</span>}</code>
    filters to easily get the first or last item from an array.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added 
    <code>{<span>{ disquslink() }</span>}</code>
    to Disqus extension.
  </li>
  <li>
    Better detection of which objects not to traverse in ` 
    <code>{<span>{ print() }</span>}</code>
    . Fixes #131.
  </li>
  <li>
    When deleting a record, also delete its relations and taxonomies. Fixes #94.
  </li>
  <li>
    Display an error when either Postgres or MySQL is selected, but databasename or password is omitted from the config
  </li>
  <li>
    Don''t allow fieldnames with dashes in it in 
    <code>contenttypes.yml</code>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Added 
    <code>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</code>
    for sqlite. Huge speedboost for slow filesystems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Correctly returning values for 
    <code>localdate()</code>
    in Twig, simplifying the ''locale'' setting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Publish "Timed" records at the right time. Fixes #211.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since we use UTF-8 and HTML5, don''t translate everything to HTML entities. Handle multibyte strings better in TrimText. Fixes #214.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made 
    <code>''taxonomies''</code>
    behave like 
    <code>link =&gt; value</code>
    arrays.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added 
    <code>{<span>{ showimage }</span>}</code>
    tag, analogous to ` 
    <code>{<span>{ fancybox }</span>}</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added '' 
    <code>order()</code>
    '' filter, to sort/order an array of records on a field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added 
    <code>config:get</code>
    and 
    <code>config:set</code>
    Nut tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don''t change the slug, if it''s already set. Fixes #222.
  </li>
  <li>

  <li>
    New feature: Make sure usernames, email-addresses and displaynames are unique.

If you''re upgrading, see the note below the changelog.</p><p>Major improvements and changes in this release, since Bolt 1.1.4:</p><ul><li>Bolt now supports <strong>custom routing</strong>. This means you''ll have much more freedom in what the URLs of your Bolt site look like. Before version 1.2, all links to content looked like <code>/{contenttype}/{slug}</code>. With Bolt 1.2, you can have pages that have links like <code>/about-us</code> or <code>/contact</code>, or you can have your weblog at <code>/blog/2013-09-13/lorem-ipsum</code>.</li><li>There''s a <strong>new search functionality</strong>. You can search through one, multiple or all contenttypes at once. The results themselves are weighted, so better results float to the top (basically, title-like fields and fields that are used for slugs are assumed to be most relevant for the results. You can also add a ''<code>searchable: false</code>'' to any contenttype, to exclude that specific contenttype from search altogether.</li><li>You can now have <strong>required fields</strong> in your contenttypes, and they can also have (frontend) validation. Using this, you can make sure fields are filled out by the editors and that they have a specific format or maximum length. See <a href="http://docs.bolt.cm/content#required-and-patterns">this page</a> in the documentation for details.</li><li>The <strong>configuration</strong> that is stored in the <code>.yml</code> files in <code>app/config/</code> is now accessible as a proper object throughout the entirity of the code, including extensions. This used to be a giant multi-dimensional array, which became very clunky. An additional benefit if this is that it''s quite a bit faster: The config files are read, parsed and cached. Bolt automatically detects changes in the files, to reload them only if needed. The automatic check for required changes in the database are only done when needed.</li><li>Speaking about the configuration files: You can now move the entire <code>app/config/</code> folder outside of your webroot. There are already several ways we prevent access to these files, but this is an extra level of protection for these files that might contain sensitive information.</li><li>We''ve added a <strong>Redirector extension</strong>. Using this extension, you can forward (old) links to the correct content in your Bolt site with a proper 301-redirect. It supports wildcards and input restrictions for quick and simple forwarding. This extension was developed by <a href="https://github.com/foundry-code">Mike Anthony at Foundry Code</a>.</li><li>You can now manually edit the slugs, if you don''t like the slug that''s automatically generated by Bolt. See screenshot:<br />&nbsp;<img alt="" style="width: 413px; height: 132px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" src="/files/2013-09/Screen Shot 2013-09-13 at 12.26.56 PM.png" /></li><li>Added support for the <strong>PHP 5.4 builtin web server</strong>.</li><li>You can now have <strong>multiple imagelists</strong> in a single contenttype. The imagelists themselves can also hold a lot more images now.</li><li>We''ve added a <strong>Google Plus One extension</strong>, courtesy of <a href="http://github.com/thereulenspiegel">Till Klocke</a>.</li><li>We''ve made a few <strong>improvements for performance</strong>. Especially pages on the frontend of your websites render a lot faster now. In content-heavy sites the difference can be as much as 500%, but in most cases the speedup is 200 to 300 percent. See the screenshot below for a before/after comparison of both the Bolt backend as well as a typical rendered page:<br /><img alt="" style="width: 445px; height: 347px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" src="/files/2013-09/optimisations.png" /></li><li>Many improvements were made to the SimpleForms extension. We''re debating a name change, because by now it can handle a lot of different forms.</li><li>Updated doctrine to version 2.4.0 final.</li><li>Updated Underscore.js to 1.5.2.</li><li>Updated Moment.js to version 2.2.1</li><li>All Symfony components are updated to 2.3.3.</li><li>Updated jQuery to version 1.10.2.</li><li>Bugfix: Fixed some issues with Pagers.</li><li>Bugfix: Don''t remove relations, when editing the ''receiving'' end.</li><li>Bugfix: Fix path settings for windows servers.</li><li>Don''t prefill dates if they''re not set.</li><li>Fix: <code>record.previous()</code> and <code>record.next()</code> are working again.</li><li>Fix: Make sure we don''t store empty slugs. Also better checking to prevent duplicate slugs.</li><li>Added functionality for extensions to add items to the menu in the Dashboard under ''settings''.</li><li>Fix issue where checkboxes with ''<code>default: 1</code>'' are not stored when unchecked.</li><li>Change: We''ve changed the login screen, to be more user-friendly.</li><li>Change: We''ve refactored <code>{<span>% setcontent %</span>}</code>. The behaviour in templates is the same, but the code is better structured.</li></ul><p><strong>Note for upgrading:</strong><br />Because ''config'' is now an object, instead of an array, it needs to be addressed differently. If you used config settings in your templates, you will have to update these.

We''ve found that when you''re working on content, almost all of the time you either need to upload a new file, of you need one that you''ve uploaded very recently. Our Stack functionality keeps track of your latest uploaded files, and allows you to access them as conveniently as possible.<br /><img alt="" style="width: 296px; height: 250px;" src="/files/2013-11/stack.png" /></li><li>Bolt now keeps a <strong>running log of all changes</strong> to the content. If you''re working with a team of editors, you''ll be able to see who edited which page on the website. You know, so you can blame whoever introduced a particularly embarrassing typo.</li><li>The automatic thumbnails are much more performant now. <strong>Generated thumbnails</strong> get saved to the filesystem, so the webserver can access them directly, thereby completely bypassing the entire PHP layer. Before version 1.3, Bolt already cached the resized images, but you still had the overhead of PHP. This change makes image-heavy sites feel a lot more responsive.</li><li>We’ve incorporated the acclaimed <strong>Symfony Developer Toolbar</strong>, and modified it to Bolt’s specific needs. When developing a website, the toolbar is invaluable to see which templates are used, which routes matched, what the environment variables are, which queries the database did, and how much time and memory it took to render the page.<img alt="" style="width: 735px; height: 244px;" src="/files/2013-11/Screen Shot 2013-11-07 at 16.13.36.png" /></li><li>We’ve made a bunch of improvements to our built-in <strong>search functionality</strong>:<ul><li>The search algorithm works much better when having more than one search term. The index-scores of the individual search terms are added to each other, making the best&nbsp;results automatically float to the top.</li><li>Taxonomies (tags and categories) are also indexed now.</li><li>By default the search engine yields pretty good results, because the algorithm gives higher scores matches in titles than a match somewhere halfway down the content. However, you can manually override the search weights for fields and taxonomies for each individual one. This way, you can influence the scores how you want them.</li></ul></li><li>We added a new <strong>RelatedContentByTags extension</strong>. This extension makes it very simple to add ‘related content’ links to any page. The algorithm calculates the relevance of other content (in the same or in another content type) based on the used tags. If you’re tagging your content consistently, the automatic results are very accurate.</li><li>Speaking of which: to aid in using tags consistently, we’ve added a <strong>tag selection cloud</strong> to the backend, as well as a autocomplete suggestion. This greatly reduces misspellings or variants of the same tag. No more “starwars”, “star wars” and “star-wars”!&nbsp;<img alt="" style="width: 772px; height: 328px;" src="/files/2013-11/tags.png" /></li><li>You can now set global <strong>Swiftmailer settings</strong> in <code> config.yml </code> , for example to make Switmailer use STMP or a specific server.</li></ul><p>All in all, there have been about 350 commits to our Github repository. Too much to list them all, but some of the other fixes and additions are:</p><ul><li>Some <strong>security-related issues</strong> have been fixed:<ul><li>Fixed a few (theoretical) XSS problems in both the frontend and backend of the site.</li><li>Better cleanup of user-submitted queries to prevent XSS and passing through of control-characters</li><li>Require <code> POST </code> instead of allowing <code> GET </code> for several functions in the backend</li><li>Added the option to use other (better) random number generators, for more randomness in generated keys, passwords and hashes.</li></ul></li><li>Added more locations where you can upload files (in the WYSIWYG editors, in the file management screen, in the sidebar). Same goes for uploading and inserting documents in the editor.</li><li>Updated Symfony components to 2.3.6</li><li>Updated Silex to 1.1.1</li><li>Added Codeception testing framework, and added a bunch of functional tests that are run continously by Travis. This is still a work in progress: More tests are added over time.</li><li>Added Krumo, for easier dumping and debugging of variables.<br /><img alt="" style="width: 389px; height: 256px;" src="/files/2013-11/krumo.png" /></li><li>Added new RSSAggregator extension. Thanks, @sekl</li><li>Sitemap extension automatically adds a header to the HTML</li><li>You can now use relative dates in the where-parts of <code> {<span>% setcontent %</span>} </code> , like “last monday” and “next year”</li><li>Added a <code> ||| </code> -parameter to the query part of set content, so we can use multiple columns as OR clauses</li><li>Fix for <code> || </code> and <code> &amp;&amp; </code> in queries, when having more than two values.</li><li>Added <code> ceil </code> and <code> floor </code> filters, to round numerical values up or down to the nearest integer value.</li><li>Added <code> slug </code> filter, to dynamically create a “sluggified” version of any string.</li><li>Added Hungarian translations</li><li>Updated Finnish translations</li><li>Added Brazilian Portugese translation</li><li>Updated Spanish translation</li><li>Updated Italian translations</li></ul>',	'',	'');

  As you might know, we''re going to release Bolt 1.4 soon. Very soon, actually! After that we''ll start working on Bolt 2.0, which is scheduled to be released at the end of Q1 2014. Perhaps the biggest change in that version will be a re-built backend. We are going to implement it, so we can take better advantage of the possibilities for mobile devices, as well as take a good, hard look at making things simpler and more straightforward for our end-users.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  To get this done, we''re going to do a "code sprint" next month. From the&nbsp;24th to the 26th of January&nbsp;a small group of us is going to the Dutch island of Vlieland, to get a lot of things done when we''re together in one location. And to have fun, obviously.

  So far, we''re with 5 people.&nbsp;If you''re reading this, and would like to help us, you''re more than welcome. Either by joining us on Vlieland in person, or joining remotely. I''m sure there will be enough to do for anybody: We''ll need to think about the UI / UX for functionality in the backend, we need to do HTML/CSS work on the templates for the backend, as well as "regular" PHP-coding. We could also use people to help out refining and expanding the documentation. So, if you''re available and would like to help: Don''t hesitate to get in touch!&nbsp;

At the end of march 2014 we’ll release Bolt 2.0.

You can! More on this <a href="/newsitem/bolt-sprint-in-january-or-boltcamp-2014">can be found here</a>. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Highlights of this release:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Caching</strong>: Bolt now has Built-in support for full-page and request caching. Using this allows you to significantly speed up the frontend of your websites. If enabled, cached pages can be shown without the need to gather data from the Databases and rendering the pages. For example, see this screenshot of the profiler for a cached page. You’ll see the entire ‘controller’ part is skipped, as&nbsp;soon as Bolt determined the visitor can be served a page that has been cached.&nbsp;<br />Note: When logged in, you will not see this behaviour by default. Logged-in users will always get a ‘fresh’ page, to make sure they will see all latest changes.&nbsp;<br /><img alt="" style="width: 550px; height: 324px;" src="/files/2013-12/Screen Shot 2013-12-24 at 12.12.30.png" /></li><li><strong>Roles and Permissions</strong>. We now have support for a more extensive Roles and Permissions structure in Bolt. It is designed in such a way that it’s very non-obtrusive when working with a small team, but it allows for very fine-grained control over who’s allowed to do what, if that’s what you need. Every aspect of this is controlled by the new `permissions.yml file: You can define roles, and set up permissions that are global or specific to one or more contenttypes. The default file will suffice for the vast majority of websites, but you can add as many roles/permissions as you like. Documentation for these features <a href="http://docs.bolt.cm/permissions">can be found here</a>.</li><li>We have a brand-new <strong>MenuEditor extension</strong>, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/bacbos">@bacbos</a>. This extension will allow you (or your editors) to manage the menus in menu.yml in a visual way. Of course this extension works with our new Roles and Permissions, so you can determine who should have access to it, and who shouldn’t.&nbsp;<br /><img alt="" style="width: 550px; height: 272px;" src="/files/2013-12/Screen Shot 2013-12-24 at 13.30.27.png" /></li><li>Added a new <strong>MetaTags extension</strong>, for easier insertion of meta tags into the HTML source of your pages, and “SEO”-ing your titles.</li><li>Bolt can be configured to use <strong>SSL-only</strong> (‘https’), for all access to the backend.&nbsp;</li><li>You can now add <strong>custom views</strong> for contenttype listings in the overview and the dashboard.</li><li>Menus in `menu.yml` can now be nested deeper than two levels.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Simpleforms</strong>: Option to log user’s IP-address and timestamp of when the form was posted.</li><li>Simpleforms: Option to disable the built-in CSRF protection.</li><li>Simpleforms: Added option to use ReCapthca in your forms. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu">@julianxhokaxhiu</a>.</li><li>Updated Dutch, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and French translations.</li><li>Added <strong>Norwegian Bokmål.</strong> Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/hansfn">@hansfn</a>.</li><li>Added <strong>new “Filelist” field</strong> for Contenttypes. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/doertedev">@doertedev</a>.</li><li>Replaced the quirky cleanup of HTML with the new&nbsp;<strong>HTMLmaid component</strong>. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/tdammers">@tdammers</a>.</li><li>Improved the <strong>“ImportWXR” extension</strong> (for PivotX and Wordpress): It uses way less memory, imports categories, and other tweaks.</li><li>Streamlined the ‘save’ / ''save &amp; return''&nbsp;workflow. There''s now also a conformation dialog to&nbsp;prevent closing window/tab with unsaved changes, and finally: you can now use ctrl-s or command-s to save the current item.<br /><img alt="" style="width: 273px; height: 154px;" src="/files/2013-12/Screen Shot 2013-12-24 at 13.31.32.png" /></li><li>We added a new “<strong>PasswordProtect” extension.</strong> Using this extension you can easily add a password protection to one or more of your pages.<br /><img alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 232px;" src="/files/2013-12/Screen_Shot_2013-12-24_at_13_35_41-2.png" /></li><li>The record.previous() and record.next() can now use&nbsp;<strong>‘where’ statements</strong> for more control over what constitutes of the&nbsp;‘previous’ or&nbsp;‘next'' item.&nbsp;</li><li>Images can now be <strong>deleted</strong> in the File browser.&nbsp;</li><li>Updated <strong>Symfony to 2.4.0</strong>. The most notable aspect of this for Bolt users are the improvements to the developer toolbar.</li><li>Tweaked timthumb.php. It should now work properly on all kinds of odd servers, proxy-settings and old browsers alike.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Major refactoring</strong> on&nbsp;‘bootstrap.php’ and&nbsp;‘app.php’. Moved all relevant code to it’s own class, and streamlined all the providers. Removed and refactored out quite a bit of dead code. Large parts of the codebase have been cleaned up to adhere to the PSR-2 standard.</li><li>And, as usual, there’s quite a few bugfixes and smaller improvements in this release.</li></ul><p>To upgrade an existing install, or to setup a new one, just follow the instructions&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.bolt.cm/installation">for installation</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.bolt.cm/updating">for updating</a>.

Bolt 1.6 is a faster, more secure, and overall more consistent system than ever before. We didn''t really plan for this version after the release of 1.5, but we kept on making incremental improvements, and we had a _lot_ of people contribute smaller or bigger fixes, features and other improvements on our Github repository. As such, this release provides a really solid base, going forward. This release also contains a number of security-fixes and while none of these issues were exploitable from ''the outside'', we still recommend this update for all Bolt users.

Amongst all the other improvements and fixes, we''ve had to introduce two "breaking changes", in order to prepare the codebase for the upcoming big 2.0 release. Please read below for instructions on how to make sure the upgrade goes smoothly. Also, if you did the upgrade without preparation, and something is broken now: **GO READ BELOW**!

Improvements and changes 
------------------------
  - The new **''Base 2014''** theme is now the default theme for fresh installs, and it''s available in the update. It''s still pretty basic (by design), but it''s fully responsive. And it''s built with Foundation 5 and Sass. <br><a href="/files/2014-05/base-2014.png" class="fancybox">![Inline Editing](/thumbs/400x300/2014-05/base-2014.png)</a>
  - Added the new **Socialite extension**: An extension to add asynchronous (lazy/late loading) social media buttons and widgets to your templates.
  - Added the new **Editable extension**: An extension to make content editable in the frontend. <a href="/files/2014-05/inlineediting.png" class="fancybox">![Inline Editing](/thumbs/400x300/2014-05/inlineediting.png)</a>
  - Built-in **support for Cronjobs** for periodically cleaning up the cache and activitylogs. The cronjobs are also extendable in your own extension code.
  - We refactored a bottleneck in checking for the names of tables. **Speedup by about 30%** of most front-end pages.  
  - You can now use **variables in your `{% setcontent %}` tags**, like this: `{% setcontent mypages = ''pages'' order my_var limit other_var %}`.
  - Added the **current publication status** to the "Edit content" screen:
  <a href="/files/2014-05/currentstatus.png" class="fancybox">![Inline Editing](/thumbs/400x400/2014-05/currentstatus.png)</a>
  - Updated CKeditor to version 4.4.0.
  - Updated Symfony and components to 2.4.4.
  - Several minor tweaks and fixes in TimThumb. Mainly to prevent broken thumbnails, and an issue where images weren''t cached correctly.
  - Datepickers in the backend now work with current localisation.
  - Ensure proper format for datedepublish fields before inserting them into the database.
  - The `templates: true` option for caching templates works better now: It no longer returns old information, for templates with dynamic parts. (i.e. ''authenticated'' pages)
  - The **MenuEditor** extension now has searcheable contenttypes.
  - Internally we used to store some fields as serialized values. These have all been refactored to use JSON. 
  - The "select from contenttype" field now has the option to add multiple fields in the selectbox. For example, to list both the id and the title, use this:
<pre class="brush: plain"> 
    selectfield:
        type: select
        values: mycontenttype/id,title
</pre>
  - Related to the previous point: It is now allowed to use key/value contenttype references in select fields.
  - Better listing of used templates in the Debug Toolbar.
  - The bundled extensions all work over HTTPS now.
  - Fix bug with sorting in the backend with contenttypes that have a `grouping` (like "chapters")
  - Make sure the cached config is invalidated whenever the version number changes.
  - Bugfix: After duplicating a record, return to the duplicate, not the original.
  - Bugfix: Removing relationships didn''t work. Fixes #1089.
  - Bugfix: When a route has a ''contenttype'' set after the `contentlink` default route, it is used instead of the custom one. Fixes #1092.
  - Security related changes: 
    - Don''t display backtrace on "Fatal error" pages, unless you''re an authenticated user. See #1166.
    - Added an `allowtwig` setting for fields in contenttypes (see below).
    - Twig inside _content_ has it''s own context now, disallowing things like `{{ dump(app.paths) }}` and such.
    - The "main menu" in the backend reflects actual user permissions. 
    - We''ve refactored the ''allowed file types'' for the stack, image field and file fields. Bolt is now much more strict in blocking uploads of disallowed filetypes.
    - The "Database needs to be updated" message is no longer shown on the login page.
    - The settings for strictness of invalidating the login works the same for ''csrf tokens'' as it already did for sessions. 
    - It was possible (for editors) to introduce XSS-issues in the content. 
  - And, there''s a bunch of other, smaller fixes and improvements. For the entire changelog, see here: [Changelog](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/wiki/Bolt-changelog---1.5.0-to-1.6.0).

This release contains many fixes and contributions by a lot of people. We''d like to thank (in no particular order): GawainLynch, DorienD, Rixbeck Gattytto, Bacbos, Xiaohutai, Tseho, Diggersworld, Ntomka, Tobias2k, Silver_Clash. Extra thanks go out to [Michael Johnson of NCC Group](http://www.nccgroup.com/research) and [Erika Heidi](http://erikaheidi.com/) for bringing some security issues to our attention. 

  To upgrade an existing install, or to setup a new one, just follow the instructions [for installation](http://docs.bolt.cm/installation) or [for updating](http://docs.bolt.cm/updating). When you do an upgrade, you will not overwrite your modified settings with the upgrade. You should still make a backup before doing an upgrade, though. Get the latest [.tgz](http://bolt.cm/distribution/bolt_latest.tgz) or [.zip](http://bolt.cm/distribution/bolt_latest.tgz), or browse the folder with [the distributions](http://bolt.cm/distribution/). After the upgrade you will be prompted to update the Database, or you can just use `php app/nut database:update` from the command line.

As mentioned before, we had to introduce two changes, that might require a bit of preparation when updating. These are edge-cases, so perhaps you might have to take care of them both, or perhaps neither. The changes are:

Change 1: Twig inside content
----------------------------

For security-reasons, you will not be able to insert `{{twig}}`-tags into _content_ anymore, unless you''ve explicitly allowed this in your contenttype. Also, the Twig parser in content now uses it''s own environment, so its scope is separated from Bolt''s internal scope. The way templates are parsed hasn''t changed at all, only the content.

For example: until version 1.6, you could do this in a template: `{{ dump(app.config.get(''general'')) }}` and it would show your entire config in the browser, including the database specifics. True, you''d have to be logged in to do this, but this still isn''t a desirable situation. We''ve taken the following steps to prevent this from accidentally happening: 
  - You need to explicitly allow twig in your contenttype. 
  - If you''re building an extension, you need to explicitly allow using it inside content fields.
  - Twig in content uses it''s own environment to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
  - Some functions like `{% include %}`, `{{ dump() }}` and `{{ redirect() }}` are disabled inside content.

From our experience most websites using Bolt, never use twig _inside_ the content, so for these sites no changes are required. If you _do_ use Twig inside your content, you will need to modify the contenttypes to allow this. This is done on a per-field basis, using the `allowtwig: true` setting:  

<pre class="brush: plain">
entries:
    name: Entries
    singular_name: Entry
    fields:
        ...
        body:
            type: html
            height: 300px
            allowtwig: true
</pre>

Change 2: Using keys for content-types
--------------------------------------

For contenttypes where no slug was explicitly set, Bolt used to determine the slug of that contenttype primarily by the ''title'', and now we use the ''key'' in the YML. If you''re already used to explicitly defining the `slug: ` in your contenttypes, this change will **not** affect you. For example, you''re fine if your contenttypes look like this: 

<pre class="brush: plain">
entries:
    name: Entries
    singular_name: Entry
    slug: entries
    fields:
        title:
</pre>

If you did _not_ set the slug explicitly, and the ''key'' is different than a sluggified version of the ''name'', you need to change this. For example, this case is not OK:

<pre class="brush: plain">
contenttype1:
    name: Entries
    singular_name: Entry
    fields:
        title:
</pre>

In this case, you should set the `slug:` before updating, so that it matches the `name:`. Like this: 

<pre class="brush: plain">
contenttype1:
    name: Entries
    singular_name: Entry
    slug: entries
    fields:
        title:
</pre>

After the update you should check the ''overview'' page in the Bolt backend for
all of your contenttypes. If it shows your content, you''re good! If it shows an
empty screen, you will need to edit `contenttypes.yml` to correct this, as
described above. If you forget this step, Bolt might not recognize the tables as
their correct names, requiring you to rename the tables manually to access your
data. **No data will be lost** in either case, but we still feel the need to
point out that you should make a backup before updating.');
